All documents in this repository are Jupyter notebooks designed to guide you in reproducing the results from our paper published 
in Physical Review B, 111(4):045101, 2025.
In this work, we developed a novel restricted Boltzmann machine incorporating essential non‚Äêlocal connections, efficiently and 
accurately representing arbitrary toric code ground states, extending its applicability to a wide range of complex quantum systems. 
While our research involved extensive experimentation and repetition, the selected notebooks included here outline the key ideas 
and methods necessary to replicate our main results.
